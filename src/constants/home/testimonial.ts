      "I had the pleasure of hosting Moyinoluwa Adelowo at the UCI Robot Ecology Lab during the summer of 2024. Moyinoluwa was a hard-working and highly capable team member, consistently demonstrating a strong work ethic, technical expertise, and a collaborative spirit. Moyinoluwa worked on integrating new robots into our swarm robotics testbed, the Robotarium. His ability to quickly learn new skills, take on complex tasks, and work effectively with the team made him an effective member of the lab in a short amount of time. I'm confident that his skills and proactive approach will make him a strong addition to any team or organization.",
